## 4. Cost Profile Justification
- Costs this week reflect **sustained VM activity**, AKS cluster usage, and supporting resources (network, storage, IPs).  
- IoT Hub demo resource charges decreased significantly compared to Week 1.  
- Increased forecast reflects **continuous VM consumption** expected for the rest of the billing cycle.  

## 5. % Change from Previous Week with Justification
- **Total cost**: US$62.45 vs US$62.62 → **-0.27% decrease**  
- **Justification**: Total spend remained stable, but the cost structure shifted — IoT Hub charges dropped, while AKS and VM usage rose.  
- **Forecast increased** due to ongoing workloads projected to run for the full billing month.
